# We deliberately build in a git-less environment (in a container, git is on
# the host-side, the source is mounted into the container), but don't want to
# change the source. What to do? Well, provide an alternative "git" executable.
# You're currently reading it.

# What does the source _use_ git for? So far, it seems the only subcommands
# currently used are;
#   - "git describe", for obtaining a textual token for versioning purposes
#   - "git log", for producing AUTHORS, CHANGES, etc.
